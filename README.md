### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have been a full stack developer for 3+ years. Currently as a software engineer in Therap Services LLC, I work with Spring MVC. As a part time software consultant, I have helped business build software in the MERN stack along with software built for mobile in native Android and Flutter. As a very careful back end developer, I prefer type safety over dynamic typing, hence I love working with Typescript and Java.
