### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have been a full stack developer for 3+ years. Currently as a software engineer in Therap Services LLC, I work with Spring MVC. As a part time software consultant, I have helped business build software in the MERN stack along with software built for mobile in native Android and Flutter. As a very careful back end developer, I prefer type safety over dynamic typing, hence I love working with Typescript and Java. 

##### So far in my career I have:

- Helped a GMBH(German LLC) create a daily data pipeline from SquareSpace orders to their in house ERP system. Previously, data migration was done manually, which needed employees with significant computer skills and training. Automating the process save 1400$ in man-hours.

- Helped an argentine company develop a POS application for local steak restaurants. Worked on building a digital menu during Covid-19 which helped businesses stay afloat.

- Worked with Bangladesh govt. agencies for creating simple Android applications for sharing information regarding their departments.

##### About me:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building my own lifestyle business
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning business management
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that help build my portfolio
