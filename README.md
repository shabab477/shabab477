### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have been a full stack developer for 5+ years. I am working at the Postcode Loterij as a full stack engineer, where I help with the tooling which marketing team uses to build ad campaigns in order to sell lottery tickets. 

#### So far in my career I have:

- Left everything behind in Bangladesh and moved to the Netherlands for work, so far best decision career/life - wise.

- Showed expertise in both front end and back end development, leading to my current job as a full stack developer.

- Worked as a consultant for Audi, helping them build their data portal and micro-services for their car fleet.

- Helped a GMBH(German LLC) create a daily data pipeline from SquareSpace orders to their in house ERP system. Previously, data migration was done manually, which needed employees with significant computer skills and training. Automating the process saves 1400$ monthly, in man-hours.

- Helped an argentine company develop a POS application for local steak restaurants. Worked on building a digital menu during Covid-19 which helped businesses stay afloat.

- Worked with Bangladesh govt. agencies for creating simple Android applications for sharing information regarding their departments.
